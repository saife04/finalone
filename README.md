spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=postgres
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update
``` 

You can choose `create` proprety for `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` to create data base each time you lunch the app or `update` proprety to update database each time you lunch the app without dropping the schema.
